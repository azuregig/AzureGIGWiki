# About the Azure Geospatial Interest Group

🌐 A community of people interested in working with location data on Azure. 🌐

## Status 
🚧 just setting up, collaborators welcome

## Intention
A place to:
- share code and approaches to geospatial analytics
- collect pointers to useful data sources and how to consume them
- support specialised disucssions in sub-teams (e.g. working with British National Grid data)

Scope: 
- Azure native, Open Source on Azure, or working with partner technologies such as Esri ArcGIS, Databricks and others. 

## How to contribute
Raise an issue to request group membership if 
- you'd like to join discussions, 
- you'd like to start a repo within this org, 
- you have an existing repo that you'd like us to fork or to move here. 

Otherwise please hold off until the first public repos within this organisation are available for specific contributions.
