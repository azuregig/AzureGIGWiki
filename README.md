# About the Azure Geospatial Interest Group

🌐 A community of people interested in working with location data on Azure. 🌐

## Status 
🚧 just setting up, collaborators welcome

## Intention
A place to:
- share code and approaches to geospatial analytics
- collect pointers to useful data sources and how to consume them
- support specialised disucssions in sub-teams (e.g. working with British National Grid data)

## How to contribute
Raise an issue to request group membership if you'd like to join discussions, or you have a repo that you'd like to start within this org, or even an existing one that you'd like to move here. 

Otherwise please hold off until the first public repos within this organisation are available for contribution.
